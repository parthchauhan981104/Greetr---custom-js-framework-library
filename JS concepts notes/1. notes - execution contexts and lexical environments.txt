Syntax Parser - A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if 
its grammar or syntax is valid.

Lexical environment - Where something sits physically
in the code you write, the word lexical means having to do with words or grammar.
So we're talking about the code you're writing, it's syntax, it's vocabulary. Now, lexical
environment exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.
let's say a function, with a variable inside of it.The variable sits lexically
inside the function, that is physically the code that you're writing, that's where it sits.
The program, the compiler that's converting your code to those instructions cares
about where you put things, and what surround it.

Execution context - A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. There are lots of 
lexical environments,areas of the code that you are looking at physically. But which one 
is currently actually running? Is managed via what's called execution contexts.
And an execution context contains your code, the running code. It's running your code, but
it also can contain things beyond what you've written in your code. Cuz remember again,
your code is being translated, being processed by a whole other feature.
A whole other set of programs that someone else wrote.
Base execution context is Global execution context.

Object - Simply in JS, a collection of name-value pairs. Value might be other name-value pairs.

Global execution context - global means things accessible everywhere in code - "Not inside a function".
JS engine Creates 2 things - Global Object, special variable 'this'.
In case of browsers, the global object is 'window'. Each tab will have its own object.
At global level, this = window. Variables and functions created outside all other functions
get attached to the window object. At global level, there is no "Outer Environment" i.e its 'null'.

Hoisting - Variable and functions are to some degree available even if they are written later in
the code, because the execution context is created in two phases.
First phase(Creation phase) - global object and 'this' are set up in memory. Reference or link to Outer environment
if there is one. Memory space is set up for variables and functions before the line by line execution begins (Hoisting). 
So during execution, JS engine can access them. But different manner for functions and variables.
Function in its entirety is placed into memory space, meaning that the function, its name and the code
inside the function is being executed. Variables have 'undefined' values as a placeholder. Value assignemnt happens
in execution phase. So should not rely on hoisting and should always access variables after they have been assigned
values.
console.log(x); //outputs 'undefined' , x is available but it has value undefined untill its set in execution phase
x=5;
var x;

console.log(y); //outputs 'undefined'
var y = 5;

z=5;
console.log(z); //outputs 5
var z;

Variables and constants declared with let or const are not hoisted!

undefined is a special keyword/value meaning the variable hasn't been set, but it takes space in memory.
we can set a variable to undefined explicitly, but shouldn't.

Execution phase - runs code line by line. Interpret, Convert, Compile, Execute. 

Single threaded synchronous execution - Only one command is executed at a time. JS may not be single
threaded under the hood, but from a programmer prospective it behave like it. Synchronous means one
at a time, and in order. JS is single threaded synchronous execution in behavior.

Function Invocation and Execution Stack - invocation means to run the function, with parantheses.
At first, when JS code is run a Global execution context is created. Execution stack has Global 
execution context at bottom. Memory is setup for variables and functions in the creation phase.
Anytime we execute/invoke a function, a new execution context is created and put on the execution stack. 
The top element of stack is the one which is currently running. Every function creates a new execution 
context. In which 'this' variable is created for that function, then it runs through the creation phase 
sets up variables, and then executes the code line by line within the function.
Even if a function is invoking itself, same process happens.
When one function finishes, it pops from stack.

Variable environment - where variable live(Scope) and how they relate to each other in memory. Variables(var)
having same name but declared again inside different functions - have different values, as they are in their
own execution contexts.

Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.

If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
// code here can use carName
console.log(carName);
function myFunction() {
  carName = "Volvo";
}
In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.
Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.
In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).

Scope Chain - Scope means where a variable can be accessed. Scope chain is act for searching for chain of reference 
to outer environment.
Case 1 -
function b() {
	console.log(myVar); //outputs 1 (not 2 or undefined)
}
function a() {
	var myVar = 2;
	b();
}
var myVar = 1;
a();

Every execution context has a reference to its outer environment.
For both func a and b, outer environment is global context, even though a is directly below b
in the execution stack. In terms of lexical environment, function b sits on top of global environment, i.e 
its not inside function a. Its on same level as the line var myVar=1; . JS cares about lexical environment
when it comes to the outer reference that every execution context gets. When we ask for a variable in any
particular execution context, and it cant find it, it will look at outer reference and go look for variables
there. Where the Outer refrence points depend on where function sits lexically.
Case 2 -
function a() {
    
    function b() {
        console.log(myVar); //outputs 2
    }
    	var myVar = 2; //if this was not declared output in b would have been 1
	b();
}

var myVar = 1;
a();


let declaration - allows JS engine to use 'block scoping'. We cant use the variable until the line of code
is run during the execution phase, that actually declares the variable.
if(a>b>{
	let c = true; //will give error
}
c is available only inside this block at that period of time for the running code.


Asynchronous - means more than one at a time. JS engine(synchronous) is one part of a browser, but there are other 
things like the rendering engine, http request, etc. JS engine has hooks where it can talk to these. Using this JS 
engine can change what webpage looks like or request data. If all this is running asynchronously, it only means that
the JS engine is working with these other element, asynchronously inside the browser. JS engine in itself is synchronous.

Event Queue - list that sits inside the JS engine. This is full of events, notifications
of events, that might be happening. So when the browser, somewhere outside the JavaScript engine, has an event that
inside the JavaScript engine we want to be notified of, it gets placed on the queue. And whether or not we actually have
a function that needs to respond to it, well, we can listen for that event and have that function handle that event, 
but either way the event gets placed on the queue. This event queue is looked by JS when execution stack is empty, then it
periodically looks/checks (called event loop) at event queue and waits for something to be there. If something is there it checks 
if a particular function should be run when that event was triggered. example - clickHandler(). If a click event is there, it 
creates execution context for that function, its processed. And next item in event queue moves up, so on. But event queue wont be 
processed untill execution stack is empty i.e JS has finished running all other code line by line. SO it isnt really asynchronous. 
Browser is putting things into event queue asynchronously, but code still runs line by line. So long running functions can interrupt 
with handling events.
This is how JS deal with asynchronous events that happens outside its engine.
