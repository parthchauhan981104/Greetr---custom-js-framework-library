# Greetr - Custom JS framework library (just for learning and using JS concepts)

* When given first name, last name, and optional language, it generates formal and informal greetings.
* Supprt English and Spanish languages.
* Reusable library/framework (won't interrupt with any other code)
* Easy to type 'G$()' structure (like jQuery)
* Also support jQuery (can give it a jQuery object that points at some HTML element and fill that element with generated greeting)
